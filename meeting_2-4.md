# 2-4 Meeting

## Google hangouts, 5pm

## In attendance

- Alex Sandridge
- Connor Dowd
- Garrison Lee
- Ann Marie Mahon
- Kakam Chen
- Joshua Correll

## Decisions made and actions taken

- Showed demo of learning task and start of name+face
  - Instantaneous feedback would be good, as well as showing the correct answer (not just count)
  - Multiple choice for name+face is ok, especially as we are not focusing on training memory
  - Order of tasks: learning has to be first, but after that not important.  Multiple ways this could be implemented.
- Hangouts work well for future meetings
- Need to find another time
- Heroku: May need an account, but depends on Google Sheets integration
- System design document as a task for next meeting

## Next meeting

TBD, will reach out once a time is found
