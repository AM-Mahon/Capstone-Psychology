## Questions

- Server is already used for things like this, they use JTOS(?), contact Psych dedicated IT john.roberts@colorado.edu
- Morphing done ahead of time, not done locally on phone.  Sets with varying levels of similarity provided to team.  Could be possible to implement locally, but is beyond scope given current manual process for morphing.
- Levels would be within a category (i.e. black level 1 is separate from chinese level 1).  Categories have yet to be defined (e.g. Asian vs Chinese & Japanese).  Increased levels equals increased nuance.
- Primary goal WRT licenses is to be able to use the software, publish the app on app stores, and write papers using and based on the app.  Beyond that, exact terms unclear and up to team.
- Nothing set WRT which tasks are the most effective
- Unknown whether or not decreased CRD for one race affects others, but would assume no as familiarity with own race does not reduce CRD for others.  This app may help answer that question more fully.
- Effect with mixed race is a hard question, but is a growing population and therefor category.  Easiest way to think about it is the variability you are exposed to.  Faces exist in "n-dimensional cloud", mixed race would be on the edges of those spaces, but is unclear.
- Own race does not affect CRD, most important is environment.  Example: study of Korean adoptees in France vs Koreans who are studying in France.  Adoptees performed more like native French in recognition of European vs Asian, while Korean students performed more like Asians.
- Cool to see tasks first, potentially memory task although it is difficult.  Build tasks first, use that to test collecting and pushing data.

## Other topics

- Setting up Slack for easier communication
- Potential for other meeting times, but will maintain current time on Monday every other week as safety
