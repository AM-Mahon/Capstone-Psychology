## Topics covered & Decisions made

- Introductions
- Questions from group
  - Difficulty:
  - number of faces people handle at a time increases with level
  - face morphing
  - Certain tasks are not necesarily more difficult than others, although this could change
  - Tracking performance over time:
    - Server in the psych department in the exists
    - Cross-device preferable but not a requirement
    - Primary goal is psych has access to data, syncing is secondary
  - Data protection is going to be determined be Institutional Review Board, aim for anonymized
  - Feedback
    - Instant is better
    - Learning + assessment phase.  e.g. 4 minutes is instant feedback, 1 minute is a "quiz" with report card at the end
    - Reporting performance over time "would be more than nice"
  - Minimum block to complete
    - Reference DuoLingo, you have to restart a block if you stop in the middle (disregard above?)
    - Couple minutes at a time
  - Amount of content
    - Sponsor has a week or two of activities in mind
    - User focus: how much do we expect each user to do?
    - In a lab context only couple of weeks.  Would people do it outside a lab?
    - If element of randomization is possible, aim for it.  Depends on work load.
  - Format
    - Would be nice to have app on iOS, Android.  No internet connection needed (beyond install)
    - Ideal: app, people can download it totally separately from a lab environment
  - Learning techniques
    - Most are reflected in the nature of the tasks
    - Individuation training, wholistic recognition
    - Instant feedback AND showing the correct solution
- Tasks
  - Name + face
  - Forced choice
  - Who's new
  - Memory
  - Encode-Recognition
  - Shuffle
- Charter
  - Problem: No good way to train people on faces
  - Include name + face, who's new, memory, shuffle.  Set of faces for each module (not random)
  - difficulty determined by morphing of faces to make all faces in module more similar

## Status report

- Project name, date
- Progress made
- Issues encountered, todo items (and dates)
- Metrics: number of meetings, duration, attendance, issue tracker?
- Milestones (charter)
