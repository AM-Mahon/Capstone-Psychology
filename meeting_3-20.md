## In attendance

- Ann Marie Mahon
- Connor Dowd
- Alexander Sandridge
- Josh Correll
- Balbir Singh

## Topics covered and decisions made

- Allow for retaking a training task instead of home -> task again?
- Avoid names like Tony/Anthony in the same set.  Will get a set of names from Josh.  Have names tied to each face, will be predefined so 64 faces 64 names in total.
- Make sure faces are not indistinguishable in memory at later levels.
- Keeping the same face size between devices is good to reduce variability.
- Add label for what is your answer vs correct answer.
- Making sure game is fun and engaging is important.
- Two or three seconds to encode in same different/forced choice.  No time limit on response.
- Dashboard and logging in/out clarification
- Preassessment is only once, before level one.  Not one before each level.
- There is a test after each level.  Then one longer postassessment once after all levels are completed.
- May have one large set of faces that is shared across all level tests.  Reduces variation between levels and number of duplicates.
- For pre and post assessments use special set of morphed faces for same/different.
- For who's new use faces from other days.  Will also make day 8 inherently harder since they are all familiar.
- Scoring memory: 1/4 point reduction for incorrect answer
- Collect demographic information (race, nationality, gender, age)
- Show score on screen during the task if possible.  Helps gamification.
- About us tab: get paragraph from sponsor to fill it in.
